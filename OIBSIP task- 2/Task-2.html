                    <p><strong><em>Sardar Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel</em></strong>,was born in Nadiad, Kheda district, and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.He was a successful lawyer.One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, Borsad, and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and 1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.
                    <p>As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for partition refugees fleeing to Punjab and Delhi from Pakistan and worked to restore peace.
